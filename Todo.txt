wall hooks:

Break blocks 
	Spelunky kaizo hacks has you break a block for a Ledge, but then there is a lava behind it to make you move quick


Basic feel goods to add
	Sticky feet on land
		Will need accel and decel first
		Quick stop when landing if input is opposite of move direction
	Push up through a semisolid 
		Make a collision box that detects it is in a semisolid (and still holding jump) and put player on top of platform
		Could use for multiple abilities like dash
	If the joystick is slightly pushed, don’t go over edges
	Add platform momentum to character (looks like godot 4 does that)
	Extend wall detection when trying to use abilities
		You can actually wall jump 2 pixels from a wall. (That sounds tiny but this is a 320x180-resolution game :P)
		If you're doing a "super wall jump" (ie: a wall jump while dashing upward), this is a more precise and demanding maneuver so we let you do it from even further away (I think it's 5 pixels, which is more than half a tile!)
	Wall ability control
		different jump if holding up
		jump/dash way from wall


Adjust air control
Be a bit different than ground 
​​What I usually do is treat mid air horizontal velocity change as interpolation from the current velocity to the player's desired velocity. Godot has a built in lerp function that's helpful for this. You would do something like current_hvel.lerp(input_hvel, arbitrary_fraction × delta). Hvel stands for Horizontal velocity. That arbitrary fraction will make the jump feel weightier at lower values. 0 will make it impossible to move in the air.
With this method you will infinitely approach the goal velocity, but technically never actually reach it. To solve that, just clamp it at the end to the desired velocity if the difference between the current and desired is small enough.
SMW actually has a lot of hidden mechanics, while it might look to be a very standart movement it has some neat details
SMW does a neat trick to change the jump height
The height is varied by lowering the "force" that moves you down when you press the nump button
(Which results in an interestingly dynamic way of changing your jump height, as well as allowing to change your fall speed by holding the jump button pressed)
(Barely any game does its jump like that anymore, but I adore it cause of how great it feels when you know it and play some Kaizo)


SMW also makes the top speed a little complicated
As (simmilarly to SMB3 I think) it has 3 top speeds:
Walking speed
Running speed
P-Speed
Walking and running speed are pretty intuitive, but P-Speed is reached by filling up a meter by going Running Speed
(And as it doesn't get reset to 0 instantly you can drag out the filling of the P-Meter for some time)


There's also ways to go beyond the p-speed cap in smw, for example sliding.
However when you press the directional pad it resets that speed, so the way to keep it is by not pressing any directional keys and keeping yourself away from the ground.


But in general this is a really handy video to see a few basic movement speeds compare
Would've been great to see some measurement numbers alongside them, though that would've taken a lot of resources
